# NLP-lab

The purpose of todays lab is to calculate and validate the customer sentiment (polarity) based on reviews of purchased womens clothing, as an introduction to using NLP techniques on text data and retrieving actionable data insights per department / division at the womens clothing company.

This lab has been designed to be completed at either Starter level or Stretch level - in order to accomodate different technical / time / motivation levels in the class. Starter - is the minimum required deliverable for today's lab, so you should complete the steps below as directed before submitting the url to your notebook via the student portal. Stretch will take you longer and the actions you will take are prompted, rather than prescriptive.

You will follow the instructions and concepts you saw in class today to:

- retrieve the data
- sample customer reviews using textblob
- use a function to apply sentiment analysis to the whole data set
- visualise the sentiment by department / division
- visualise to validate the sentiment analysis
- apply another sentiment analyser
- identify and evaluate the differences between each approach
